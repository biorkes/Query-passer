# Query-passer

Query-passer is a simple script that passes all query strings from the current URL to all existing `<a>` tags in a page.

The script helps you to keep the query strings across all pages in your website.

Hashtag anchors (`<a href="#info">`) will be placed after the query strings (`<a href="?cid=1#info">`).
